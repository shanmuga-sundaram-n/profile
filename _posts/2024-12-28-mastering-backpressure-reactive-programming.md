![Mastering Backpressure in Reactive Programming](/assets/images/blog/backpressure-reactive.jpg)

Reactive programming allows developers to build highly responsive and scalable systems that handle asynchronous data flows. But a fundamental challenge emerges when **producers emit data faster than consumers can process it**.

Without a solution, this imbalance leads to memory overload, CPU exhaustion, and cascading failures. The solution is **backpressure**.

---

## What is Backpressure?

Backpressure is the mechanism that allows a consumer to communicate to its producer that it cannot keep up with the current data rate. Rather than silently dropping messages or crashing under load, a well-designed reactive system uses backpressure to apply flow control.

Think of it like a water pipe: if you push water in faster than it can flow out, something bursts. Backpressure is the pressure relief valve.

---

## Why It Matters

Without proper backpressure handling:

- **Memory overload** — unbounded buffers fill up and cause OOM errors
- **CPU exhaustion** — the consumer thrashes trying to process an overwhelming queue
- **Cascading failures** — one slow consumer can destabilise an entire pipeline
- **Silent data loss** — messages get dropped without any indication

---

## Four Core Backpressure Strategies

### 1. Buffering

Temporarily store excess data in a bounded buffer. When the buffer fills, apply additional pressure upstream.

```java
// Project Reactor
Flux.range(1, 1000)
    .onBackpressureBuffer(100) // buffer up to 100 items
    .subscribe(item -> process(item));
```

**Use when:** Data loss is unacceptable and consumers will eventually catch up. Be careful with buffer size — an unbounded buffer is no protection at all.

---

### 2. Dropping

Discard items when the consumer falls behind. Simpler than buffering, but only appropriate when losing some messages is acceptable.

```java
// RxJava
Flowable.interval(1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
    .onBackpressureDrop()
    .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())
    .subscribe(item -> slowProcess(item));
```

**Use when:** You're processing real-time streams (metrics, sensor data) where stale data has no value.

---

### 3. Throttling

Control the emission speed from the producer to match consumer capacity. Instead of buffering or dropping, you slow the source down.

```java
// Akka Streams
Source.repeat("event")
    .throttle(10, Duration.ofSeconds(1)) // max 10 elements per second
    .runWith(Sink.foreach(System.out::println), system);
```

**Use when:** The producer is controllable and you want to maintain a steady, sustainable flow rather than bursts.

---

### 4. Requesting (Pull-based)

Consumers explicitly request a specific number of items from the producer. This is the most precise form of backpressure — the foundation of the Reactive Streams specification.

```java
// Project Reactor — limit rate to 10 items at a time
Flux.range(1, 1000)
    .limitRate(10) // consumer pulls 10 items at a time
    .subscribe(item -> process(item));
```

**Use when:** You want fine-grained control over throughput and can predict consumer processing capacity.

---

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Default Strategy | Key API |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Project Reactor | Error on overflow | `onBackpressureBuffer()`, `limitRate()` |
| RxJava | Configurable | `onBackpressureDrop()`, `onBackpressureLatest()` |
| Akka Streams | Built-in propagation | `throttle()`, `buffer()` |

All three follow the **Reactive Streams specification**, which standardises backpressure handling through the `Publisher`/`Subscriber` contract.

## Best Practices

1. **Match strategy to data criticality** — financial transactions need buffering; live metrics can afford dropping
2. **Always bound your buffers** — unbounded buffers defer the problem rather than solving it
3. **Test under realistic load** — backpressure issues only surface at production traffic levels
4. **Understand your consumer's processing capacity** — profile before tuning
5. **Monitor queue depths** — expose buffer utilisation as a metric to catch pressure building up

---

## Key Takeaway

Backpressure isn't an edge case — it's a core concern in any reactive system that handles real-world load. Choosing the right strategy (buffer, drop, throttle, or request) depends on your data's criticality and your consumer's characteristics. The frameworks provide the tools; understanding the trade-offs is the engineering judgment that makes them work.
